Dynamic Audio Data Augmentation
Our preprocessing pipeline incorporates dynamic audio data augmentation to enhance the robustness and generalization of our models. This includes:

Adaptive Noise Injection:

Types of Noise: White, Pink, and Environmental.

Implementation: Noise is injected dynamically based on the selected profile, simulating realistic recording conditions and enhancing model robustness.

On-the-Fly Spectrogram Parameter Adjustment:

n_fft and hop_length: Values for n_fft and hop_length are randomly selected from predefined ranges for each audio sample, providing varied spectrogram representations.

Efficiency and Performance
Log-Mel Spectrogram Manipulation:

Our augmentation process seamlessly integrates into the existing log-Mel spectrogram calculation, adding no extra overhead. This efficient design ensures that our preprocessing remains computationally lightweight and fast.

Key Benefits
Enhanced Robustness: By varying spectrogram parameters and injecting realistic noise, our models learn to handle a wide range of audio conditions.

Low Overhead: The augmentation is integrated into the existing pipeline, ensuring minimal additional computational cost.

Example Usage
To enable dynamic audio data augmentation in your data loader, simply adjust the flags when calling your collator.


--------------
This approach provides a constant source of novel data variations, enhancing model performance without significant resource demands. The efficiency of our method makes it especially suitable for training models on low-resource languages or diverse audio datasets.

Context-Aware Noise Injection
Types of Noise:

We use different profiles such as white noise, pink noise, and environmental noise to simulate a variety of real-world conditions.

Dynamic Selection:

The noise type and intensity are dynamically selected for each audio sample, ensuring that the augmentation varies across different training iterations.

Realistic Augmentation:

By choosing noise levels and types that match the characteristics of the original audio signal, this method helps the model learn to generalize better to different recording environments.

Seamless Integration:

The noise injection is integrated into the existing preprocessing pipeline, which includes the log-Mel spectrogram calculation, ensuring minimal additional overhead.

Benefits
Enhanced Robustness: Models trained with context-aware noise injection can handle a wider variety of audio inputs, making them more resilient to noise in real-world applications.

Efficiency: By leveraging the existing log-Mel spectrogram pipeline, the noise injection process incurs minimal overhead, maintaining a high level of computational efficiency.

#### Adaptive Context-Aware Noise Injection

Our preprocessing pipeline incorporates adaptive context-aware noise injection to enhance model robustness.
