On-the-Fly Spectrogram Parameter Adjustment:

Values for n_fft and hop_length are randomly selected from predefined ranges for each audio sample, providing varied spectrogram representations.
Most asr models use log mel spectrograms which are "picture" representations of sound (its all data). If you augment the audio you augment the spectrogram.. You get the idea.. 
Probably best to hold off with this technique until you are starving for data (low resource language people). I havent actually tested this.
##### Example Usage

```python
data_collator = DataCollatorSpeechSeq2SeqWithPadding(
    processor=processor,
    decoder_start_token_id=model.config.decoder_start_token_id,
    apply_augmentation=True,
    apply_noise_injection=True  # Enable adaptive noise injection
)

dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True, collate_fn=data_collator)

for batch in dataloader:
    outputs = model(batch)
